<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Each week I&#39;ll record your contributions to the class/group following the same outline.
You&#39;ll export this assignment to markdown (or download it as a markdown file) and add it to your group&#39;s Github.
You&#39;ll want to change the file name to include your ucid so it doesn&#39;t conflict with anyone else&#39;s files if it&#39;s in the same directory.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required to keep this branch in sync with all team members each module/week (you shouldn&#39;t cause anyone to lose their work).

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The issue that I had when I was working on this assignment was<br>that I wanted to use the SCP command to move files from one<br>virtual machine to another virtual machine. The issue that I was having was<br>that I was not able to find the IP address using the configif<br>file (which is the picture that is shown above). To fix this issue,<br>Google cloud has both internal and external IP addresses that can be found<br>on the virtual machine page. I used the internal IP address to solve<br>this issue.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
